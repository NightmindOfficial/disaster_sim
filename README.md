# DISASTER Simulation Strategizer
## What is this?
This is a quick and (very) dirty Streamlit app hammered together so I can get first place in a business trading under uncertainty simulation that took place at my university in 04/2024.

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ with Streamlit installed.

In case you need to install Stramlit, do that first via ```pip install streamlit```.

Then, in a console, run ```streamlit run predict.py``` and you should be good to go.

## How to use the interface

This should be self-explanatory. Feel free to contact me in case you have any questions. Also, feel free to fork and adapt the files to your needs.
